* hosts2zone

** Description

Convert entries from /etc/hosts to unbound local zone
hat is my old code and therefore it smells

** Roadmap

Short roadmap on improving situation with smelling code:

*** TODO Use fgets(3) instead of getline(3) 

hosts(5) says that lines in file are already limited to
BUFSIZ characters (currently 1024).

*** DONE Rewrite makefile

Use includes and BSD make.

*** TODO Rewrite parsing

I need to rewrite hosts parsing.
he best way is found out how system does it already.
/etc/hosts is parsed by gethostbyname() by default,
some code can be borrowed from here.

*** TODO Delete portability.

It was not tested and is done messy by ifdef macros.
